I am a videogame lover since I was a child. I started to study Computer systems engineering because I wanted to create games, that is my passion.
Nonetheless, I am interested in other areas such as mobile apps, web development and UX/UI. I have worked before making texture packs, so I have
experience using software like Photoshop.

Now I am a Java and C# developer, currently working for a indie gamedev company, learning some things of making games.
