- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CesarJZO
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web, mobile and game development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity and C.
- ðŸ“« You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CesarJZO), my learning progress on [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/u/cesarjzo?tab=activity) and [DomÄ•stika](https://www.domestika.org/es/cesarjzo), also I have a [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/CesarJZO) and, of course, my email cesarjzo@outlook.com

I am a videogame lover since I was a child. I started to study Computer systems engineering because I wanted to create games, that is my passion.
Nonetheless, I am interested in other areas such as mobile apps, web development and UX/UI. I have worked before making texture packs, so I have
experience using software like Photoshop.

Now I am a Java and C# developer, currently working for a indie gamedev company, learning some things of making games.
