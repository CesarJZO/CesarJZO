- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CesarJZO
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web, mobile and game development.

- ðŸ“« You can find me on twitter as @CesarJZO or my email: cesarjzo@outlook.com

I am a videogame lover since I was a child. I started to study Computer systems engineering because I want to create games, that is my passion.
Nonetheless, I am interested in other areas such as mobile apps, web development and UX/UI. I have worked before making texture packs, so I have
experience using software like Photoshop.

Now I am a Java developer, currently learning Git and C# because right now I'm focusing in game development. And, I have not mentioned that I also
love to code, I try to do it as simple and efficient as possible.
