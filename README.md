- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CesarJZO
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game development and most related to front end dev.

I am a videogame lover since I am a child and started to study Computer systems engineering because I want to create games, that is my passion.
Nonetheless, I am interested in other areas such as mobile apps, web development and UX/UI. I have worked before making texture packs, so I have
experience using software like Photoshop.

Now I am a Java developer, currently learning Git and C# because right now, I'm focusing in game development. And, I have not mentioned that I also
love to code, I try to do it as simple and efficient as possible. Right now I am working also in publishing all my school projects and use git to
make them better, at least cleanup the code.

I think that is it for today.
