- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CesarJZO
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game development and operating systems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity and C with **The C Programming Language** [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).
- ðŸ“« You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CesarJZO), my game dev learining progress on [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/u/cesarjzo?tab=activity), also I have a [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/CesarJZO) and, of course, my email cesarjzo@outlook.com
- ðŸ‘” Just created my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesarjzo/) account! And soon I'll create my first proper portfolio.

I love videogames since I was a child. I started to study Computer systems engineering because I wanted to create games. Today, I'm fulfilling that dream making games using Unity.
Nonetheless, I am interested in other areas such as operating systems, I love to use the terminal, so I'm learning C (btw I want to make a DOOM port).
